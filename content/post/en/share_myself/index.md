This is my first video sharing my life and thoughts in English. Actually, I am really afraid of facing the camera, and my spoken English is also very poor. But I believe that the best way for a person to improve and grow is to do things that scare him.

In addition, I want to record my own tracks and upload them to the Internet. I don't have many friends. Maybe one day, when I am gone, my traces can still be saved on a certain network server, so even if no one remembers me, the content about me will still exist in binary form on some machines. At least after I die, my traces can still exist in this world for a while longer.

I used to think that I was a very ordinary person, and my life and thoughts were not worth sharing, whether sharing with friends or posting on the Internet. Now the Internet and various media platforms are filled with junk content, like a huge garbage station. Of course, there are indeed high-quality and valuable content. So, I think it is not an exaggeration to throw my life into this "garbage station".

I am an ordinary programmer now. Sometimes I often feel that I have just graduated and I am still young enough. But in fact, I have become old. I need to think about my future and enjoy the world in time. Just like a movie I participated in, 1/4 has been released, and I still expect the remaining 3/4 to be more exciting.
