Hi, guys. My name is Vidge. This is my first video to share my life and thoughts in English. Accturelly, I am so afraid to face to camera and my English speaking is so bad.
But I trust that the best way let a people improve or growth is to do something they scraed! Other way. I want to record my trace and push to intenet. May be some day I dead that my tarce can be still exist in a web server.
I don't hvae many friends. So this world! Please remember me! I think my thouths could share to my friends but that so nomorel. And intnente or medule paltform fill many rubbish just like a complex rubbish station. I trust that have good and vluaed thins.
So I push my thoughts to rubbish station is a good way. Althrougth I don't know this video if will be rubbish in future.

I just a programmer at this time. I even think i just gradutae no far and younger. But Accturelly. I'm already a old man and need to think my after life.
Yeah, I am ... about my age recent. In the colleage, I dont hard i can get something good. But now, only myself can provide value to me.
